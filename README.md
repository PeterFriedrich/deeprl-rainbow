This is an attempt at faithfully recreating the set of DQN variants discussed in the paper "[Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298)".

If all prerequisites are installed, can be run in the default configuration on Pong by typing "python rainbow.py".
